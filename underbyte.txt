Encoding:
	given a input png and raw bytes
		encode the raw bytes in the png by
			first setting header bytes
				encoding the length of the bytes
			then selecting a byte to pixel ratio 
				- 1:1
				- 2:1
			then selecting a pixel ordering based on a random seed
				- derived from header pixel values, or
				- derived from an input string
			and then modifying the pixels following a random seq

Decoding:
	given an input png
		decode the encoded bytes by
			first decoding the header bytes
			determining the length of the encoded bytes from the header
			getting the random seed from either
				- the pixel values of the header bytes, or
				- input string
			then decoding the bytes from the pixels 

TODO:
- actually make packing strategy a thing?
